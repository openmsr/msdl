  abstract = {The equilibrium phase diagram for the LiF-BeF2-ZrF4 system was established throughout all temperature intervals (approximately 350 to 1000°C) in which liquid-solid phase transitions occur. The liquidus surface of the LiF-BeF2- ZrF4 system comprises eight primary phase fields, those of the three components, and of five complex compounds: Li2BeF4, Li3ZrF7, Li2ZrF Li3Zr4F19, and Li6BeF4ZrF8. The associated phase reactions result in the occurrence of nine invariant equilibrium points, at temperatures which range from 355 to 540°C. A region of liquid-liquid immiscibility, rare in fluoride systems, was observed with BeF2-rich mixtures at temperatures from the LiF-BeF2-ZrF4 liquidus to an upper critical solution temperature of 955°C. Composition-temperature relationships within this region were established by use of a high-temperature centrifuge.},
