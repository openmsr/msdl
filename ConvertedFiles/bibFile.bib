    \ abstract = {The equilibrium phase diagram for the LiF-BeF2-ZrF4 system was established
    throughout all temperature intervals (approximately 350 to 1000°C) in which liquid-solid
    phase transitions occur. The liquidus surface of the LiF-BeF2- ZrF4 system comprises
    eight primary phase fields, those of the three components, and of five complex
    compounds: Li2BeF4, Li3ZrF7, Li2ZrF Li3Zr4F19, and Li6BeF4ZrF8. The associated
    phase reactions result in the occurrence of nine invariant equilibrium points,
    at temperatures which range from 355 to 540°C. A region of liquid-liquid immiscibility,
    rare in fluoride systems, was observed with BeF2-rich mixtures at temperatures
    from the LiF-BeF2-ZrF4 liquidus to an upper critical solution temperature of 955°C.
    Composition-temperature relationships within this region were established by use
    of a high-temperature centrifuge.},\n  doi = {10.1016/0022-3115(68)90120-7},\n
